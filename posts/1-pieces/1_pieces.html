<h1>Pieces</h1>

<article>
    <p>I have a hard time describing my personality to someone. I don't really like those standard off-the-shelf terms; I think I'm much more complex than that—not to brag, or maybe I'm just bad at describing things, or this might just be another crisis every teenager has been through in their life. It's crazy to think this includes my parents and siblings... Moving on though...</p>
    
    <p>I think the wallpapers I make for myself are a great showcase. They consist of pieces of myself. If you look close enough, you'll see my current mental status—what I've been thinking about lately. Like the most recent one I have created here:</p>

    <img src="9 - 2025 april.png" alt="Latest_wallpaper">
    
    <p>If you look close enough, it tells a lot. Being in university for so long has made me homesick, hence the picture of my dog Simba (I used to say I would never be homesick; this place really breaks you down sometimes. Maybe I was putting up a front).</p>
    
    <p>Lately, with all of the news going on in the world and the rate at which tech is developing, I am by no means an expert, but it's baffling how pre-COVID, the most well-known humanoid was Atlas from Boston Dynamics, and now everyone and their mom is doing it out of a garage—which is beautiful. So I dreamt of—not really my dream—but to think a humanoid with emotions will someday roam around this planet, or how, if we get to the stage of fully integrating our brains with a computer (seems unlikely anytime soon, but why not dream?), having the ability to turn off emotions. What if all hell lets loose, wars wage against robots (yeah, that topic again)... or among humans themselves, which would be more believable, given the current global state?</p>

    <p>Or, if you look over at the Man-Roach, I recently read Franz Kafka's <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, which really put me on the edge. Definitely one of my favorite short literature pieces, after <em>The Last Question</em> by Isaac Asimov, or stumbling across a video that led me to learning about Sergei Korolev, a Soviet rocket engineer who invented the R-7 Semyorka and Sputnik 1, and how he was treated by the Soviet administrations..</p>
    <p>Another key highlight of my newfound interests is chip design, computer architecture and some few glimpses of esoteric art. Nothing much to say; I just enjoy the thing (im a simple man).</p>
    <p>And then there’s how the Paul Graham tweet resonates so much over the past year. I’ve been learning mathematics on my own, not even able to solve a quadratic equation at first. It’s been humbling, but in a weird way, I’ve felt this transformation in the process, with realizations that you can really learn anything on your own. The feeling of slowly piecing things together and watching everything click over time has been so rewarding.</p>
    <p>I think this is me. I've struggled a lot about my personality, really being put off by the question of "Who am I?" (Hasn't every teenager? Lol). Maybe it's just my prefrontal cortex adding a few more neurons as I approach 21 or its a ramble about how cool my wallpapers are :).</p>
    <p>You can make more observations; I'm probably a stranger to whoever is reading this, but if you do find it interesting, I would love to hear your <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="copyToClipboard('adityareddy400@gmail.com')">thoughts or interpretations.</a> It’s always fun to see how others perceive you, especially when you’re not sure how to describe yourself. Everyone’s perspective is a little different, and sometimes, it’s refreshing to see yourself through someone else’s eyes.</p>

    <p>Here's the first one I ever made:</p>
    <img src="0 - The OG.png" alt="Latest_wallpaper">
    <p>Looking at it, I remember I started reading Orwell, who is now my favorite writer. Having just finished my 12th grade, processing a breakup, discovering music establishing the my ever-changing tastes, being stuck in this dilemma of dropping a year to explore (which I recommend to everyone, no matter how confident you are) or going to university for something I'm not sure about.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Fun fact: The image with the dead mosquito was taken while I was studying for my biology finals, suffering with having to memorize facts—I don't know, I think it's funny.</p></li>
    </ul>
